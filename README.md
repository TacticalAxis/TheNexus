# TheNexus
The Nexus search engine was created in 2018 as a substitute to other search engines. It previously used private APIs to get search results. Since 2021, the website has been updated to use YaCy â€“ a decentralized peer-to-peer search index to provide results to this API. Due the fact that this service is purely anonymous and uncensored, search results will get you much more interesting results than you could find on other search engines.

Hello, and welcome to the nexus. The next best search engine
Our end goal is to replace the google search engine, not their other products such as mail or drive. We are competitors of Google(the current best), Bing, Yahoo Search, and Duck Duck Go search engine. We intend to be better than them. 

The purpose of this website is to create an amazing experience for people who just want to browse the web, and who require the minimalistic look of our website, rather than the cluttered up web pages of our competitors - the ones previously noted. 

We currently have the most respect for privacy, most minimalistic setup and most easiest-to-use graphical user interface, compared to that of our competitors. 

We highly respect our user's privacy and because of that, potentially ISPs, your company, institute, college, or school cannot track any of your searches*. We believe that privacy is a fundamental right that all humans must have.

We hope you enjoy your web browsing experience here, at the nexus.

*If you click on one of the search results that go to another page, then that is what will be tracked. But any of the searches that you do on our website do not appear in the URL like how Google does it, as we want to protect the user as long as they are within our limits. as soon as you click a link on another website, it may potentially be in your tracking record.
